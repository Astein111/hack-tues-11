                <h3>Do a morning stretch</h3>
                <p>
                    Stretching before getting out of bed wakes up the body, improves circulation, and promotes relaxation, 
                    helping to set the day's tone. While you're still lying in bed, move the covers aside, then flex and 
                    release your lower limbs several times. Bend your knees and lift your legs into the air. With your 
                    legs still elevated, flex your feet up and down and rotate them side to side. Next, sit up and slowly 
                    look left and then right. Roll your shoulders several times. Flex your wrists up and down, and open and 
                    close your hands repeatedly.

                    Proper hydration supports digestion, improves brain performance, and increases energy, among other health benefits. 
                    Drink a big glass of water after you wake up and a glass with every meal.

                <h3>Nap</h3>
                <p>
                    Afternoon naps can recharge a weary body and may boost cognitive function. A study published online on Jan. 25, 2021, by
                    General Psychiatry found that nappers scored higher on cognitive tests than non-nappers. The researchers found that shorter 
                    and less frequent naps — lasting less than 30 minutes, no more than four times a week — were associated with the most benefit. 
                    Schedule naps for the early afternoon , and use a timer so you don't oversleep.
